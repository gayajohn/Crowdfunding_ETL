## Project Objective
The following project extracts, transforms and loads data on crowdfunding campaigns. We built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we exported four CSV files and used the CSV file data to map out an ERD (entity relationship diagram), which was used to buikd the table schema on SQL. Finally, we imported the CSV file data into a Postgres SQL database, and ensured that the data loaded properly.

## Raw Data Sources
- crowdfunding.xlsx
  
  This .xlsx file contained campaign data which was normalized in order to create category and subcategory tables
